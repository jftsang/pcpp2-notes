# Practical Python

Comments and corrections to [J. M. F. Tsang](j.m.f.tsang@cantab.net).

Just a collection of useful or interesting (or simply cute) things I've learnt
about Python.

Some of these notes are intended to cover some of the material in the syllabus
for [PCPP 2: Certified Professional in Python
Programming](https://pythoninstitute.org/certification/pcpp-certification-professional/pcpp-32-2-exam-syllabus/).
